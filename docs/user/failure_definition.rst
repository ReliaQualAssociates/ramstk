Failure Definitions
===================

Failure definitions should be developed and agreed upon early in the
development program.  These failure definitions should be used throughout the
entire life-cycle of the product.  It is best to define failures as the
functions are being defined.  Functional failure definitions will fall into
one of the following categories:

#. Too much function.
#. Too little function.
#. Intermittent functionality.
#. Function not there when required.
#. Function present when not required.

As requirements/specifications are identified these functional failure
definitions can be amended with performance values or new, performance-based
failure definitions can be added.
