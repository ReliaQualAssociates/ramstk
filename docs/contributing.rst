Code of Conduct
===============

The fundamental rules are:

* **DON'T be a Gavin Belson.**  You probably are smarter and more successful than everone else, but be humble and helpful.
* **DON'T be a Jian Yang.**  Stealing other people's IP is lower than a snake's belly.
* You *CAN* be a Bertram Gilfoyle, that's fundamentally just being an engineer.
* You *CAN* be a Big Head, but only if you invite me to all your house parties.
* You *CAN* be an Erlich Bachman because the world needs dreamers.
* You *CAN* be a Richard Hendricks, because ethical software is a good thing.
* You *CAN* be a Dinesh Chugtai because every team needs someone to good-heartedly pick on.

See the Code of Conduct file in the root `RAMSTK` directory.

How to Contribute
=================

See CONTRIBUTING.md in the docs directory.  This is likely out of date, so ask
if you have any questions.

Coding Standards
================

See CODING_STDS.md in the docs directory.  This is probably out of date so you
might review some of the existing code base to see how badly I haven't followed
my own standards.
