How to Contribute
=================

    CONTRIBUTING.md

Coding Standards
================

The coding standards below are probably out of date so you might review some of the existing code base to see how
badly I haven't followed my own standards.  I also open issues to document conventions and standards.  That'd be another
good place to look.

    CODING_STDS.md

Development Environment
=======================

Another document that is likely out of date, but might be helpful if you're interested in hacking on RAMSTK and opening
pull requests.

    DEVELOPMENT_ENV.md

API Documentation
=================
