<h3>Reporting Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#reporting-issues" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The only dumb issue is the unreported issue.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The purpose of an issue (or bug, condition, corrective action, FRACA) tracking system is to document <strong>conditions adverse to quality (CAQ)</strong> and their fixes.  A mispelled word in documentation or a docstring is a condition adverse to quality so <em>submit an issue</em>.  This section guides you through submitting an issue report for RAMSTK.  Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you find a <strong>Closed</strong> issue that seems like it is the same thing that you’re experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</section>
<section id="before-submitting-an-issue-report">
<h3>Before Submitting an Issue Report<a class="headerlink" href="#before-submitting-an-issue-report" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Perform a search</strong> to see if the problem has already been reported.  If it has <strong>and the issue is still open</strong>, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-to-submit-a-useful-issue-report">
<h3>How to Submit a Useful Issue Report<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-submit-a-useful-issue-report" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Issues are tracked as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ReliaQualAssociates/ramstk/issues/">GitHub issues</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Use a clear and descriptive title</strong> for the issue to identify the problem.  When you create a new issue, you will be presented with an <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ReliaQualAssociates/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md">issue template</a>.  Please use the template to report your issue.  If you choose not to, you may be asked to provide the information requested or your issue may simply be closed with no action taken.</p>
<p>There are four sections in an issue report:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Expected Behavior</p></li>
<li><p>Actual Behavior</p></li>
<li><p>Steps to Reproduce the Problem</p></li>
<li><p>Operating Environment</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the <strong>Expected Behavior</strong> section, the minimum information needed is to
complete the user story:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">As</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nb">type</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">RAMSTK</span> <span class="n">stakeholder</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">want</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">goal</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">so</span> <span class="n">that</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">need</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">goal</span><span class="o">&gt;.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It is important that the voice of the customer (VOC) be captured up front.  The
VOC statement(s) are converted to engineering requirements.  Engineering
requirements can be tested to verify the code meets the requirement.  A simple
way to capture the VOC is to fill in the following statement.  You may include
multiple, related, user statements in a single issue.</p>
<p>RAMSTK has been a long time in the making and was originally created to bundle
together several small (mostly) Excel-based tools and move data storage to a
database rather than a spreadsheet.  As such, the design process was not very
rigorous and no engineering specifications were ever created; I knew what I
wanted my tool to do for me and didn’t need to document that.  You’re welcome
to call me lazy, but your user story (stakeholder’s input in RAMSTK vernacular)
will be used to develop engineering specifications for RAMSTK.  In fact, you
can submit an issure report as a quality type issue and provide nothing more
than the completed user story (stakeholder input).  Not all users
(stakeholders) are external users of RAMSTK.</p>
<p>If submitting an enhancement type issue, provide a step-by-step description of
the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.  Explain why this
enhancement would be useful to most RAMSTK users.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Actual Behavior</strong> section, <strong>describe the behavior you observed</strong> and
point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.  If the problem
wasn’t triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the
problem happened.</p>
<p>The <strong>Steps to Reproduce the Problem</strong> section only needs to be completed for
an issue classified as a bug.  Quality, enhancement, and question type issues
by their nature are not reproducible.  When completing this section:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem</strong> in as many details as possible; <strong>don’t just say what you did, but explain how you did it</strong>. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps</strong>. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.  If you’re providing snippets in the issue, use <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines">Markdown code blocks</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Include screenshots and animated GIFs</strong> which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.  You can use <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cockos.com/licecap/">this tool</a> to record GIFs on Windows, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast">this tool</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz">this tool</a> on Linux.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To gather the information required for the <strong>Operating Environment</strong> section, execute something such as the following to get the required run-time package versions for the list.  You will need a copy of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ReliaQualAssociates/ramstk/requirements_run.txt">requirements_run.txt</a> file in the repository.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>for file in $(cat requirements.txt | cut -d &#39;=&#39; -f1 | cut -d &#39;&gt;&#39; -f1);
do
    version=$(pip show $file | grep Version: | cut -d &#39;:&#39; -f2 | tr -d &#39;[:space:]&#39;);
    echo &quot;  * &quot;$file==$version;
done

<h2>For Developers’ Eyes Only<a class="headerlink" href="#for-developers-eyes-only" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>As a RAMSTK developer, if you are working on something outside the RAMSTK issue system, you are likely working on the wrong thing.  If an issue doesn’t exist, create it <em>before</em> you start writing.  The issue system is there to facilitate managing the development program and creating schedules.</p>
<section id="style-guidelines">
<h3>Style Guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#style-guidelines" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Please refer to the RAMSTK Coding Standards.</p>
<section id="pull-requests">
<h4>Pull Requests<a class="headerlink" href="#pull-requests" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do not include issue numbers in the PR title.</p></li>
<li><p>Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Document new engineering specification(s).</p></li>
<li><p>Document new code.</p></li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="branch-naming">
<h4>Branch Naming<a class="headerlink" href="#branch-naming" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>RAMSTK uses GitHub actions to manage tagging and releasing.  Conditional actions are often based on pull request labels.  These labels, in turn, are automatically applied based on branch names.</p>
<p>Major version bumps will occur whenever a pull request has the label ‘major’.  Major version changes seldom occur and, as such, will be labeled manually.  Minor and patch version bumps will occur when a pull request has the label ‘minor’ and ‘patch’ respectively.</p>
<p>RAMSTK uses a GitHub action to apply the ‘minor’ and ‘patch’ labels to a pull request.  These labels are applied based on the pull request’s base branch name.  The file .gihub/pr-labeler.yml contains the up to date mapping between branch name and pull request label.  At the time of writing, the mapping is as follows:</p>
<p>| Branch Name |      Label(s)      |
| ———– | :—————– |
| feature/*   | feature, minor     |
| feat/*      | feature, minor     |
| fix/*       | bug, patch         |
| bugfix/*    | bug, patch         |
| hotfix/*    | bug, patch         |
| enhance/*   | enhancement, patch |
| chore/*     | chore              |
| test/*      | chore, quality     |
| tests/*     | chore, quality     |
| refactor/*  | chore, quality     |
| doc/*       | docs               |
| docs/*      | docs               |</p>
<p>Please adhere to the branch naming convention above if you plan to open a pull request against RAMSTK.</p>
</section>
<section id="git-commit-messages">
<h4>Git Commit Messages<a class="headerlink" href="#git-commit-messages" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>There is a commit message template in the root directory for RAMSTK named .gitcommitmessage.txt.  Use this template to build commit messages.</p>
</section>
<section id="always-add-descriptive-log-messages">
<h4>Always Add Descriptive Log Messages<a class="headerlink" href="#always-add-descriptive-log-messages" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Log messages should be understandable to someone who sees only the log. They shouldn’t depend on information outside the context of the commit. Try to put the log messages only to those files which are really affected by the change described in the log message.</p>
<p>In particular put all important information which can’t be seen from the diff in the log message.</p>
</section>
<section id="use-issue-system-numbers">
<h4>Use Issue System Numbers<a class="headerlink" href="#use-issue-system-numbers" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Add the bug number to the log message. In order to keep the issue tracking system in sync with the git repositories, you should reference the issue report in your commits, and close the fixed issues in the issue tracking system.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that you don’t need an understandable log message.  It should be clear from the log message what has been changed without looking at the issue report.</p>
</section>
<section id="issue-comments">
<h4>ISSUE Comments<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-comments" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>When working on an issue, pull request, etc., you very well may find a section of code that needs work.  If this section of code is within the scope of your work, make the changes.  If it is out of scope, add an ISSUE comment using the following format:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># ISSUE: &lt;One-line description of required work.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Long and detailed description of work to be performed.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The github action, dtinth/todo-actions will find these ISSUE comments when code is pushed to the master branch and convert them to an issue.  We believe it is more efficient to identify issues and document them in-line while working rather than having to stop and open an issue.  This results in better issue management.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="process-guidelines">
<h3>Process Guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#process-guidelines" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>RAMSTK attempts to use:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Test driven development</p></li>
<li><p>Trunk based development</p></li>
<li><p>Continuous integration</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="never-write-a-test-that-doesn-t-have-an-engineering-specification">
<h4>Never Write a Test That Doesn’t Have an Engineering Specification<a class="headerlink" href="#never-write-a-test-that-doesn-t-have-an-engineering-specification" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>It’s not necessary to create a user story (stakeholder input) prior to writing an engineering specification, but it is perfectly acceptable to do so.  As a developer, you may simply write the engineering specification.  If working on an issue reported by a stakeholder, convert their user story to an engineering specification.  Communicate with the stakeholder who reported the issue if you need clarification.  This process helps identify epics versus simple user stories and will result in a better product and happier users (developers will be happier too).</p>
<p>A test does not need to be code executable by pytest.  It may be a step by step procedure or checklist.  This would be appropriate for GUI design/layout related specifications where it would be more efficient to simply launch RAMSTK and visually inspect that the specification is met.</p>
</section>
<section id="never-write-code-that-doesn-t-have-a-test">
<h4>Never Write Code That Doesn’t Have a Test<a class="headerlink" href="#never-write-code-that-doesn-t-have-a-test" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>And make sure the test(s) pass before committing.  If you add functionality to RAMSTK, there should be one or more tests for the new functionality.  There should be a test(s) to ensure the new code works with good inputs.  There should also be test(s) to ensure the code responds properly with bad inputs.</p>
</section>
<section id="never-commit-code-that-doesn-t-run">
<h4>Never Commit Code That Doesn’t Run<a class="headerlink" href="#never-commit-code-that-doesn-t-run" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Run the code and correct all errors before committing.  Make sure that newly added files are committed.  If they are missing your local copy will run fine but nobody else will be able to run RAMSTK.  This is not desirable.</p>
</section>
<section id="always-statically-check-your-code">
<h4>Always Statically Check Your Code<a class="headerlink" href="#always-statically-check-your-code" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Statically check every file you edit between commits.  At a minimum, the following static checkers should be used:</p>
<p>The Makefile in the root directory can be used to integrate these checkers with your editor/IDE if needed.  Depending on your editor/IDE and prefered workflow, you might have some or all run automatically as you code.  The current Makefile targets and tools associated with each are:</p>
<p>| Makefile Target |     Tools    |
| ————–: | :———– |
| format          | yapf         |
|                 | isort        |
|                 | docformatter |
| stylecheck      | pycodestyle  |
|                 | pydocstyle   |
| typecheck       | mypy         |
| lint            | pylint       |
| maintain        | mccabe       |
|                 | radon mi     |
|                 | radon hal    |
|                 | radon cc     |</p>
<p>My preference is to code, periodically run the checks above, and fix the errors/warnings raised.  Configuration for the various tools is found in either pyproject.toml or setup.cfg.  It is preferred that pyproject.toml be used if possible.</p>
<p>When using pylint, the goal is not to achieve a score of 10/10, it is to create standard, maintainable code.  You are encouraged to aggressively refactor any code.  At a minimum, submit a quality type issue describing the proposed refactoring for you or another developer to work on later.</p>
<p>In addition, it is recommended you install the pre-commit tasks found in .pre-commit-config.yaml.  This will result in the following checks being made before the commit:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Check docstring is first</p></li>
<li><p>Check for merge conflicts</p></li>
<li><p>Lint check TOML files</p></li>
<li><p>Lint check yaml files</p></li>
<li><p>Check for debug statements</p></li>
<li><p>Fix end of files</p></li>
<li><p>Prevent commits to the master branch</p></li>
<li><p>Trim trailing whitespace</p></li>
<li><p>Check code formatting with yapf</p></li>
<li><p>Check import statements with isort</p></li>
<li><p>Check docstring formatting with docformatter</p></li>
<li><p>Check code style with pycodestyle</p></li>
<li><p>Check docstring style with pydocstyle</p></li>
<li><p>Check type hinting with mypy</p></li>
<li><p>Check for lint with pylint</p></li>
<li><p>Check for commented-out code with eradicate</p></li>
<li><p>Check MANIFEST.in with check-manifest</p></li>
<li><p>Check for packaging errors with pyroma</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="double-check-before-you-create-a-pull-request">
<h4>Double Check Before You Create a Pull Request<a class="headerlink" href="#double-check-before-you-create-a-pull-request" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Do a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">pull</span> <span class="pre">--rebase</span></code> to keep your checkout up-to-date. Invoke <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">diff</span></code> before committing. Take messages from git about conflicts, unknown files, etc. seriously. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">diff</span></code> will tell you exactly what you will be committing.  Check if that’s really what you intended to commit.</p>
</section>
<section id="code-review-by-other-developers">
<h4>Code Review by Other Developers<a class="headerlink" href="#code-review-by-other-developers" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Don’t commit changes to the public API of RAMSTK without prior review by other developers.  Requiring a review for these changes is intended to avoid problems for the users of the APIs and to improve the quality of the APIs.  This is ensured by using pull requests when you’re ready to commit; the pull request will be merged by a developer with the authority to merge it.</p>
</section>
<section id="don-t-create-a-pull-request-for-code-you-don-t-understand">
<h4>Don’t Create a Pull Request for Code You Don’t Understand<a class="headerlink" href="#don-t-create-a-pull-request-for-code-you-don-t-understand" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Avoid things like “I don’t know why it crashes, but when I do this, it does not crash anymore.” or “I’m not completely sure if that’s right, but at least it works for me.”.</p>
<p>If you don’t find a solution to a problem, discuss it with other developers.  Don’t create a pull request if other developers disagree  If there are disagreements over code changes, these should be resolved by discussing them.</p>
</section>
<section id="commit-complete-changesets">
<h4>Commit Complete Changesets<a class="headerlink" href="#commit-complete-changesets" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>git has the ability to commit more than one file at a time. Therefore, please commit all related changes in multiple files, even if they span over multiple directories at the same time in the same commit. This way, you ensure that git stays in a runnable state before and after the commit and that the commit history is more helpful.</p>
<p>Commits should be preferably “atomic” - not splittable. That means that every issuefix, feature, refactoring or reformatting should go into an own commit. This, too, improves the readability of the history.  Additionally, it makes porting changes between branches (cherry-picking) and finding faulty commits (by bisecting) simpler.</p>
