ReliaFree - An open source solution for RAMS analysis.
======================================================

PRE-REQUISITES:

To install the ReliaFree application you will need the following:

    1. lxml
    2. MySQL-Python
    3. PyGTK
    4. Access to a MySQL server with CREATE and GRANT permissions that will
       allow you to create new databases and assign users.  See the section
       below entitled MYSQL SETUP.

INSTALLATION:

Installing ReliaFree is as simple as executing the setup.py script.

    python setup.py install

This will install ReliaFree to the default site-packages directory on your
system.  It will also create/install the following:

    1. Directory /etc/reliafree for system-wide configuration files.
       Configuration files will also be installed in this directory.
    2. Directory /usr/share/pixmaps/reliafree/32x32/ for image files used by
       ReliaFree.  Image files (*.png) will also be installed.
    3. Directory /usr/share/doc/reliafree-0.1.0 for documentation files.  Files
       will also be installed.
    4. Directory /usr/share/reliafree for ReliaFree shared files.  Files will
       also be installed.

Following installation of ReliaFree, it is necessary to create the reliafreecom
MySQL database.  This can be done as follows:

    mysql -h <HOSTNAME> -u <USER WITH APPROPRIATE GRANTS> -p < /usr/share/reliafree/reliafreecom.sql

If the reliafreecom database ever becomes corrupted, this command will restore
it to working order.  You will need to login to your MySQL server and create a
user named reliafreecom with SELECT GRANTS.

    mysql> CREATE USER 'reliafreecom'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'reliafreecom';
    mysql> GRANT SELECT ON reliafreecom.* TO 'reliafreecom'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'reliafreecom';

As your non-root user, issue the following commands to setup your personal
environment:

     andrew@aragorn ~ $ mkdir ~/.config/reliafree
     andrew@aragorn ~ $ cp /etc/reliafree/*.xml ~/.config/reliafree/

At this point, ReliaFree can be invoked from the command line as follows:

    andrew@aragorn ~ $ reliafree

EXAMPLE PROGRAMS:

Several example programs are provided with ReliaFree.  These are:

        mil_hdbk_217f - simply a "system" containing every component type
                        found in MIL-HDBK-217F supported by ReliaFree.
    class_a_amplifier - a simple bipolar transistor, class A amplifier.  A GEDA
                        schematic file and SPICE *.cir file are also provided.

The SQL files that will create and populate these databases are installed at
/usr/share/reliafree/examples.  To install one or more of these examples,
execute the following:

    mysql -h <HOSTNAME> -u <USER WITH APPROPRIATE GRANTS> -p < /usr/share/reliafree/examples/mil_hdbk_217f.sql
    mysql -h <HOSTNAME> -u <USER WITH APPROPRIATE GRANTS> -p < /usr/share/reliafree/examples/class_a_amplifier.sql

MYSQL SETUP:

At this point the Create New Program Database is not setting GRANT permissions
correctly when the new Program Database is created.  For know, you will need to
login to your MySQL server and manually assign the appropriate GRANTS after
creating the New Program Database.  The following statement will provide your
user the correct GRANTS.

    GRANT DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE ON new_program.* TO 'your_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
