## üé® Features

RAMSTK is built on the concept of modules where a module is a collection of
 related information and/or analyses pertinent to system development.  The
  modules currently included in RAMSTK are:

* Function Module
  - Functional decomposition
  - Hazards analysis
* Requirements Module
  - Stakeholder input prioritization
  - Requirement development
  - Analysis of requirement for clarity, completeness, consistency, and verifiability
* Hardware Module
  - Reliability allocation
      - Equal apportionment
      - AGREE apportionment
      - ARINC apportionment
      - Feasibility of Objectives
  - Hardware reliability predictions using various methods
      - Similar items analysis
      - MIL-HDBK-217F parts count
      - MIL-HDBK-217F parts stress
  - FMEA/FMECA
      - RPN
      - MIL-STD-1629A, Task 102 Criticality Analysis
  - Physics of failure analysis
* Validation Module
  - Task description
  - Task acceptance value(s)
  - Task time
  - Task cost
  - Overall validation plan time/cost estimates

## üíæ Installing

These instructions will get RAMSTK up and running on your local machine
. Note that the Makefile contains all the commands needed to install or work
 with RAMSTK.  You should consult the help output for more information.

### Prerequisites

I use [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) to manage the
 dependencies for RAMSTK while I'm developing so the requirements.txt file
  is formated for use with the pip-sync command.  However, it will also work
   with pip.

```shell
$ make requirements
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

should get all the needed runtime requirements installed if they're not
already.  The first command is needed to ensure the requirements.txt file is
updated for your Python version; some dependency versions differ with Python
version.

If you're planning to do some development work on RAMSTK, the following
 would be the better approach:

```shell
$ pip install pyenv
$ make mkvenv
$ make usevenv ramstk-venv
$ pip install pip-tools
$ make requirements
$ make depends
```

This will install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), create a virtual
 environment with the default name of ramstk-venv, activate that virtual
  environment, install pip-tools, and then install all the RAMSTK
   dependencies needed for testing, development, and runtime.

RAMSTK uses [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) for it's database
 engine.  You'll need to have a user with read/write access to a postgresql
  server to use RAMSTK.

### Download

Install any missing RAMSTK dependencies using pip, your package manager, and/or
build from source.  Then download the \<version> of RAMSTK source from GitHub
Releases you wish to install.

```shell
$ wget https://github.com/ReliaQualAssociates/ramstk/archive/v<version>.tar.gz
$ tar -xf v<version>.tar.gz
$ cd ramstk-<version>
$ make install
```

The install target recognizes PREFIX=<non-default install path> so you can
 install RAMSTK in your $HOME or a virtual environment.  Since RAMSTK is
  still a version 0 product, it's highly recommended that you install in a
   virtual environment.

```shell
$ wget https://github.com/ReliaQualAssociates/ramstk/archive/v<version>.tar.gz
$ tar -xf v<version>.tar.gz
$ cd ramstk-<version>
$ make PREFIX=$VIRTUAL_ENV install
```

RAMSTK is also available from PyPi so you can use pip to install as well.

```shell
$ pip install
```

### Running the Tests

To run the entire test suite for RAMSTK after installing, simply execute:

```shell
$ make test
```

To run the test suite with coverage, execute:

```shell
$ make coverage
```

To run specific tests or groups of tests, use pytest:

```shell
$ pytest -m integration tests/modules/test_allocation.py
$ pytest -m calculation tests/analyses/prediction
```

## üî® Usage

After installing RAMSTK, it can be launched from a terminal emulator:

```
$ ramstk
```

This is a good option if you need to file an issue as the output should be
 included in your report.

RAMSTK installs a *.desktop file and can be found where ever applications in
 the category Math or Science are listed.
