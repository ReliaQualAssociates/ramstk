## üé® Features

RAMSTK is built on the concept of modules where a module is a collection of related information and/or analyses pertinent to system development.  The modules currently included in RAMSTK are:

* Function Module
  - Functional decomposition
  - Functional FMEA
  - Hardware/Function matrix
* Requirements Module
  - Stakeholder input prioritization
  - Requirement development
  - Analysis of requirement for clarity, completeness, consistency, and verifiability
* Hardware Module
  - Reliability allocation
      - Equal apportionment
      - AGREE apportionment
      - ARINC apportionment
      - Feasibility of Objectives
  - Hazards analysis
  - Hardware reliability predictions using various methods
      - Similar items analysis
      - MIL-HDBK-217F parts count
      - MIL-HDBK-217F parts stress
  - FMEA/FMECA
      - RPN
      - MIL-STD-1629A, Task 102 Criticality Analysis
  - Physics of failure analysis
* Validation Module
  - Task description
  - Task acceptance value(s)
  - Task time
  - Task cost
  - Overall validation plan time/cost estimates

## üíæ Installing

These instructions will get RAMSTK up and running on your local machine.  Note that the Makefile contains all the commands needed to install or work with RAMSTK.  You should consult the help output for more information.

### Prerequisites

I use [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) to manage the dependencies for RAMSTK while I'm developing so the requirements.txt file is formated for use with the pip-sync command.  However, it will also work with pip.

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

should get all the needed runtime requirements installed if they're not already.

If you're planning to do some development work on RAMSTK, the following would be the better approach:

```sh
$ pip install pyenv
$ make mkvenv
$ make usevenv ramstk-venv
$ pip install pip-tools
$ make depends
```

This will install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), create a virtual environment with the default name of ramstk-venv, activate that virtual environment, install pip-tools, and then install all the RAMSTK dependencies needed for testing, development, and runtime.

### Download

Install any missing RAMSTK dependencies using pip, your package manager, and/or build from source.  Then download the <version> of RAMSTK source from GitHub Releases you wish to install.

```sh
$ tar -xf ramstk-<version>.tar.gz
$ cd ramstk-<version>
$ make install
```

The install target recognizes PREFIX=<non-default install path> so you can install RAMSTK in your $HOME or a virtual environment.

### Running the Tests

To run the entire test suite for RAMSTK after installing, simply execute:

```
$ make test
```

To run specific tests or groups of tests, use pytest:

```
$ pytest -m integration tests/modules/test_allocation.py
$ pytest -m calculation tests/analyses/prediction
```

## üî® Usage

After installing RAMSTK, it can be launched from a terminal emulator:

```
$ ramstk
```

This is a good option if you need to file an issue as the output should be included in your report.

RAMSTK installs a *.desktop file and can be found where ever applications in the category Math or Science are listed.
