## Disclaimer

RAMSTK attempts to use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) 2.0.0.  Per
spec item 4, major version 0 is for initial development and anything may
change at any time.  That is certainly the case for RAMSTK!  Because RAMSTK
is a one developer show, there is no active develop branch at the moment.
 This may change after release of 1.0.0.  Until then, tagged releases can be
used, but the `latest` tag may not work and may not be backwards-compatible.
 While major version is at 0, breaking changes will be reflected in bumps to
the minor version number.  That is, version 0.15.0 is not compatible with
version 0.14.0.

## üé®&nbsp; Features

RAMSTK is built on the concept of modules where a module is a collection of
related information and/or analyses pertinent to system development.  The
modules currently included in RAMSTK are:

* Revision Module
  - Usage profile
* Function Module
  - Functional decomposition
  - Hazards analysis
  - Failure definitions
* Requirements Module
  - Stakeholder input prioritization
  - Requirement development
  - Analysis of requirement for clarity, completeness, consistency, and verifiability
* Hardware Module
  - Reliability allocation
      - Equal apportionment
      - AGREE apportionment
      - ARINC apportionment
      - Feasibility of Objectives
  - Hardware reliability predictions using various methods
      - Similar items analysis
      - MIL-HDBK-217F parts count
      - MIL-HDBK-217F parts stress
  - FMEA/FMECA
      - RPN
      - MIL-STD-1629A, Task 102 Criticality Analysis
  - Physics of failure analysis
* Validation & Verification Module
  - Task description
  - Task acceptance value(s)
  - Task time
  - Task cost
  - Overall validation plan time/cost estimates

## üíæ&nbsp; Installing

RAMSTK uses [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) for its database
engine.  You'll need to have a user with read/write access to a postgresql
server to use RAMSTK.  Instructions for setting up the postgresql servers and
creating users with the appropriate permissions can be found in the project
[Wiki](https://github.com/ReliaQualAssociates/ramstk/wiki).

### Download and Install

Since RAMSTK is still a version 0 product, it's highly recommended that you
install in a virtual environment.  The instructions below presume you will
be installing in a virtual environment and system-wide Python packages that
RAMSTK depends on will be unavailable.  That being the case, you will need
various system development packages available via your operating system's
package manager to install RAMSTK.

Once you have installed any missing development file packages using your
operating system's package manager, download the \<version> of RAMSTK
source from GitHub you wish to install.

```shell
$ wget https://github.com/ReliaQualAssociates/ramstk/archive/v<version>.tar.gz
$ tar -xf v<version>.tar.gz
$ cd ramstk-<version>
```

The other option for obtaining the RAMSTK source code is to clone the
repository.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/ReliaQualAssociates/ramstk.git ramstk.git
$ cd ramstk.git
```

Create and activate a virtual environment however you are acustomed to.
One approach is to use pyenv and poetry.  Using pyenv isn't necessary
unless you want to install and use a Python version other than that
provided by your operating system.

```shell
$ pyenv install 3.8.7
$ poetry env use ~/.pyenv/shims/python3.8
$ poetry shell
```

This will install Python-3.8.7 and tell poetry to use the Python interpreter
you just installed.  Finally, poetry will create, if needed, and activate
the virtual environment using Python-3.8.7 as the interpreter.

Now that the virtual environment is activated, you can install the
necessary RAMSTK dependencies and RAMSTK itself.  Omitting the PREFIX
variable will cause RAMSTK to install to /usr/local by default.

```shell
$ make depends
$ make PREFIX=$VIRTUAL_ENV install
```

When upgrading RAMSTK, you can simply:

```shell
$ pip install -U ramstk
```

This will only install the latest RAMSTK version from PyPi and will leave
configuration, data, and icon files untouched.  If you cloned the RAMSTK
repository, you can also use the Makefile:

```shell
$ git switch master
$ git pull
$ make install.dev
```

### Development Dependencies

We use [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) to manage the
dependencies for developing RAMSTK.  Using the Makefile, install as follows:

```shell
$ make depends
```

This should get all the needed development and runtime requirements installed
if they're not already.

### Running the Tests

To run the entire test suite for RAMSTK after installing, simply execute:

```shell
$ make test
```

To run the test suite with coverage, execute:

```shell
$ make coverage
$ make coverage.report
```

To run specific tests or groups of tests, use pytest:

```shell
$ pytest -m integration tests/modules/test_allocation.py
$ pytest -m unit tests/analyses/prediction
```

## üî®&nbsp; Usage

After installing RAMSTK, it can be launched from a terminal emulator:

```
$ ramstk
```

This is a good option if you need to file an issue as the output should be
included in your report.  RAMSTK also installs a *.desktop file and can be
found where ever applications in the category Math or Science are listed.
If you've installed in a virtual environment or other non-standard location,
this *.desktop file may not be found.

See the User Guide for the latest usage instructions.

## Documentation

Documentation for RAMSTK is built and included as release assets.  For each
release, you will find a pdf and html implementation of the User Guide.  For
each minor and major version release, you will also find a pdf and html
implementation of the Developer's Guide.
